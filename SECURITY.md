# Security Policy

cheeseDOS is prerelease software still in early development, so bugs and vulnerabilities can be safely disclosed publicly. If you find an issue, please report it via a GitHub issue. If you know how to fix it, you can fix it via a Pull Request.

## Alpha Version Lifecycle
Every time a new alpha build in the releases page (I might release tags but not releases, the tag only ones have no changes to the user), all previous alpha builds will hit end of life.
