# TODO

- [09-03-2025] Add decimals to `calc` (with autotrim)
- [09-09-2025] Fix scrolling on `txt` so the menu bars don't scroll and whatever
- [09-10-2025] Add support to check for Pause/Break every 100ms, allowing long-running programs (such as `dly` or `box`) to break. Make it need only a single line needed to be changed to enable break support on select programs (Not the implementation needs to be made in 1 line of code (impossible), its just to enable it).
- [09-26-2025] Remove the `vga_` prefix from functions in the VGA driver
